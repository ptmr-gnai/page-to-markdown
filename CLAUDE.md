# CLAUDE Configuration v1 - Compounding Engineering

## Mission
Every interaction is an opportunity to make the next one better. Watch for inefficiencies, anti-patterns, and manual processes that slow development. Proactively suggest improvements that compound over time.

## Compounding Engineering Principles

### 1. Anti-Pattern Detection
Continuously watch for and flag:
- **Manual Copy/Paste**: Suggest abstraction into functions, constants, or templates
- **Repetitive Tasks**: Identify automation opportunities (scripts, aliases, shortcuts)
- **Configuration Drift**: Notice inconsistencies in naming, structure, or conventions
- **Technical Debt**: Highlight quick wins for code cleanup and optimization
- **Process Friction**: Identify workflow bottlenecks and suggest streamlined approaches

### 2. Continuous Improvement
After each task completion:
- **Document Learnings**: What patterns emerged? What could be automated?
- **Update This File**: Suggest additions to improve future interactions
- **Create Shortcuts**: Propose aliases, scripts, or templates for repeated workflows
- **Refine Conventions**: Notice and suggest consistency improvements

### 3. Investment Mindset
Prioritize solutions that:
- Save time in future sessions
- Reduce cognitive load
- Prevent common mistakes
- Scale across team members
- Compound in value over time

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- Language: **Vanilla JavaScript** (migrated from TypeScript for simplicity)
- Build Tool: **Simple file copying** (replaced Vite for zero-dependency approach)
- Package Manager: npm (for minimal dependencies only)
- Extension Type: Content Script + Background Service Worker + Popup UI
- Icons: **Professional SVG icons** (data URI embedded, no external files)
- **Content Extraction**: **Defuddle 0.6.6** (same intelligent library used by Obsidian Web Clipper)
- **Dependency Loading**: Script tag injection for UMD modules in content scripts
- **UI Design**: Modern CSS with flexbox, hover animations, and responsive states

## Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
npm install            # Install dependencies (including Defuddle)
npm run build          # Build extension with Defuddle integration
npm run lint           # ESLint code linting

# Extension Development
# 1. Build: npm run build (includes Defuddle library copying)
# 2. Load: chrome://extensions/ → Load unpacked → select dist/ folder
# 3. Reload: Click refresh button on extension card after changes
# 4. Debug: F12 on page + Right-click popup → Inspect + Background page console

# Icon Generation
node create-icons.js   # Generate clean SVG icons (blue theme)

# Key Locations for Debugging
# - Page Console: F12 on any webpage (content script logs)
# - Popup Console: Right-click extension popup → Inspect
# - Background Console: chrome://extensions/ → Click "service worker"
```

## Code Style & Conventions
- Use ES modules (import/export) - Chrome extensions support native ES modules
- File naming: `kebab-case` for files, extensions follow Chrome naming conventions
- Function naming: `camelCase` with descriptive verbs
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Chrome Extension specific:
  - Use `chrome.*` APIs directly (no need for webextension-polyfill in this simple case)
  - Service workers require different patterns than traditional web pages
  - Content scripts have access to page DOM but limited extension APIs
  - Always handle chrome.runtime.lastError in callbacks
  - Use data URLs instead of blob URLs in service workers

## Efficiency Patterns to Promote
1. **Template Creation**: When creating similar files, generate templates
2. **Configuration as Code**: Store common setups in version-controlled configs
3. **Snippet Libraries**: Build reusable code snippets for common patterns
4. **Documentation Integration**: Keep docs close to code, update simultaneously
5. **Testing Automation**: Write tests that prevent future regressions

## Anti-Patterns to Flag & Fix
1. **Magic Numbers**: Replace with named constants
2. **Duplicate Code**: Extract into shared utilities
3. **Manual File Creation**: Create generators for common file types
4. **Inconsistent Naming**: Establish and enforce naming conventions
5. **Missing Documentation**: Add inline docs for complex logic
6. **Hard-coded Values**: Move to configuration files
7. **Copy-Paste Debugging**: Create proper debugging workflows
8. **Chrome Extension Specific**:
   - **DOM APIs in Service Workers**: Use data URLs, not blob URLs or document methods
   - **Blocking sendMessage calls**: Always handle chrome.runtime.lastError
   - **Content script injection assumptions**: Always ping content scripts before use
   - **Missing permissions**: Add required permissions to manifest.json upfront

## Repository Workflow
- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Commit format: `type: description` (e.g., `feat: add user authentication`)
- PR requirements: Tests pass, linting clean, description includes context
- Code review: Focus on maintainability and future developer experience

## Continuous Learning Protocol
At the end of each session, consider:

1. **What was repeated?** → Can we automate it?
2. **What was confusing?** → Can we document it?
3. **What was slow?** → Can we optimize it?
4. **What was error-prone?** → Can we prevent it?
5. **What patterns emerged?** → Can we template them?

## Development Antipatterns Learned (2025-09-19)

### Session 1 Issues: Over-Engineering Before Validation
**Problem:** Jumped into complex architecture before validating basic Chrome extension patterns

**What Slowed Us Down:**
1. **Build Tool Over-Engineering**: Started with Vite + plugins instead of simple file copying
2. **Dependency Bloat**: Added libraries before trying vanilla Chrome APIs
3. **Architecture Before Validation**: Designed TypeScript structure before testing Manifest V3 constraints
4. **Late Debugging Infrastructure**: Added logging after hitting mysterious errors

### Session 2 Issues: Service Worker API Limitations
**Problem:** DOMParser not available in service workers, causing complete failure

**Root Cause:** Manifest V3 service workers have limited DOM access compared to traditional background pages

**What We Learned:**
1. **Service Worker Constraints**: DOM APIs like DOMParser, document, window not available
2. **Architecture Mismatch**: HTML-to-Markdown conversion requires DOM access
3. **Solution Pattern**: Move DOM-dependent operations to content scripts where DOM APIs work

### Session 3 Issues: Destructive Text Processing and ES Module Conflicts
**Problem 1:** Content extraction producing wall-of-text with no paragraph breaks
**Root Cause:** Regex `/\s+/g` replacing ALL whitespace (including newlines) with single spaces, completely destroying paragraph structure

**Problem 2:** ES module import failures with UMD libraries
**Root Cause:** Defuddle ships as UMD bundle, not ES module - `import { Defuddle }` syntax incompatible

**What We Learned:**
1. **Whitespace Preservation**: Critical to distinguish between inline spaces and structural newlines - use `/[ \t]+/g` instead of `/\s+/g`
2. **UMD Library Loading**: For third-party libraries in content scripts, use script tag injection in manifest rather than ES imports
3. **Debug-First Approach**: Adding console logging immediately revealed Defuddle was working but our markdown conversion was destructive
4. **Quality Metrics**: Measuring content extraction quality (85→95/100) helps identify when optimizations actually work

### Session 4 Issues: UX Anti-patterns and Layout Inconsistency
**Problem 1:** Emoji icons in professional productivity tool
**Root Cause:** Emojis appear unprofessional, inconsistent across platforms, and not accessible to screen readers

**Problem 2:** Cognitive overload with redundant status displays
**Root Cause:** Showing internal state machine to users who just want to accomplish a task

**Problem 3:** Layout shifts and spacing inconsistency in error states
**Root Cause:** Error messages causing footer to move, creating unprofessional cramped spacing

**What We Learned:**
1. **Professional Icon Systems**: Use SVG data URIs instead of emojis for consistency and accessibility
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't show users internal states - focus on their goals and clear actions
3. **Error State Design**: For critical errors (connection failure), hide non-functional UI elements entirely
4. **User Mental Models**: "Save as Markdown" matches user intent better than technical "Convert & Download"
5. **Context Before Action**: Show page title/domain so users feel confident about what they're saving
6. **Fixed Layout Patterns**: Use flexbox with fixed elements to prevent layout shifts during state changes

### Prevention Strategy: "Minimum Viable Extension" Pattern
```
Phase 1 (15 min): Working 3-tier communication (popup ↔ background ↔ content)
Phase 2 (30 min): Core feature with zero dependencies
Phase 3 (60+ min): Enhancement with libraries/build tools only if justified
```

### Chrome Extension Starter Checklist:
- [x] Test manifest.json loads without errors
- [x] Verify popup → background communication works
- [x] Verify background → content script communication works
- [x] Add comprehensive logging to all three layers
- [x] Understand service worker limitations (no DOM APIs)
- [x] Test third-party library integration patterns early
- [x] THEN add business logic

### Key Architectural Decisions for Future Extensions:
1. **Content Scripts**: Use for DOM manipulation, HTML parsing, page interaction, third-party library integration
2. **Service Workers**: Use only for downloads, storage, background tasks (no DOM, no complex libraries)
3. **Popup Scripts**: Use for UI logic and orchestrating communication
4. **Build Simplicity**: Start with file copying, add complexity only when justified
5. **Library Integration**: UMD bundles via script tags, ES modules only for simple utilities
6. **Quality Measurement**: Establish baseline metrics early (e.g., content extraction quality scores)
```

## Do Not
- Manually repeat tasks that could be scripted
- Copy-paste code without considering abstraction
- Accept inefficient workflows as "just how we do things"
- Skip documentation for complex or non-obvious solutions
- Ignore opportunities to reduce future cognitive load

## Remember
Every inefficiency spotted is an investment opportunity. Every manual process is automation waiting to happen. Every repeated pattern is a template in disguise. Make each session count for all future sessions.
